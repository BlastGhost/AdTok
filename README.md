This project was carried out as part of a course at the University of Le Mans on programming
on embedded interface programming on android.

the project has not been completed. So not all interfaces are implemented, and some implementation methods are too barbaric. 
This is due to our lack of competence and knowledge in the field of android.

# What is AdTok ?
AdTok is the TikTok of ads. Anyone can watch, like, share and comment on ads. 
By watching ads, you earn points that you can use to buy packs with exclusive ads and even rare ads to collect.


# API
In this project, we use the [Google AdMob API](https://developers.google.com/admob).

This is one of most popular API providing ads to mobile application and Unity game. When using it, please make sure to use the right ID for test. [See more here](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/test-ads)

## Native Ad
Here is the test ID to use when using native ad in your application `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2247696110`.

In our project, we need to use Native Ad as we can place them where we need them and we can also define their dimensions.
